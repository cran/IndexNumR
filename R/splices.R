#' function to calculate the new spliced datapoint

#' splice function for the different types of splicing method.

#' @param x the base by which we multiply the splice factor to
#' get the new point. Usually this is the last period of the old
#' window.
#' @param oldWindow the previously computed window (i.e. the last w
#' periods of the index that we are extending).
#' @param newWindow the new window computed in order to extend the index
#' @param method the splicing method to use. Possible options are
#' 'movement', 'window', 'mean', 'half', or a number representing
#' the period to use for the splice.
