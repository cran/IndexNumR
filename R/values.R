#' Compute values (price x quantity)
#'
#' Compute the total value (expenditure), for each time period in
#' the sample.
#'
#' @param x A dataframe containing price, quantity, a time period identifier
#' and a product identifier. It must have column names.
#' @param pvar A character string for the name of the price variable
#' @param qvar A character string for the name of the quantity variable
#' @param prodID A character string for the name of the product identifier
#' @param pervar A character string for the name of the time variable. This variable
#' must contain integers starting at period 1 and increasing in increments of 1 period.
#' There may be observations on multiple products for each time period.
#' @param sample A character string specifying whether a matched sample
#' should be used.
#' @param matchPeriod A character string specifying which period is used
#' to determine the set of products used for matching. Options are
#' "following" or "previous". "following" calculates the expenditures in the current period,
#' filtering out any products that do not appear in the following period.
#' "previous" is calculated similarly, using the set of products in the
#' previous period to filter the current period sample.
