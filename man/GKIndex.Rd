\title{Compute the Geary-Khamis index}
\usage{
GKIndex(x, pvar, qvar, pervar, prodID, sample = "", window, splice = "mean")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A dataframe containing price, quantity, a time period identifier
and a product identifier. It must have column names.}

\item{pvar}{A character string for the name of the price variable}

\item{qvar}{A character string for the name of the quantity variable}

\item{pervar}{A character string for the name of the time variable. This variable
must contain integers starting at period 1 and increasing in increments of 1 period.
There may be observations on multiple products for each time period.}

\item{prodID}{A character string for the name of the product identifier}

\item{sample}{set to "matched" to only use products that occur
across all periods in a given window. Default is not to match.}

\item{window}{An integer specifying the length of the window.}

\item{splice}{the splicing method to use to extend the index. Valid methods are
window, movement, half, mean, fbew or fbmw. The default is mean.}
}
\description{
Compute the Geary-Khamis index
}
\details{
The splicing methods are used to update the price index when new data become
available without changing prior index values. The window, movement, half and mean splices
use the most recent index value as the base period, which is multiplied by a price movement
computed using new data. The fbew (Fixed Base Expanding Window) and fbmw (Fixed Base Moving
Window) use a fixed base onto which the price movement using new data is applied. The base
period is updated periodically. IndexNumR calculates which periods are the base periods using
\code{seq(from = 1, to = n, by = window - 1)}, so the data must be set up correctly and the
right window length chosen. For example, if you have monthly data and want December
of each year to be the base period, then the first period in the data must be December
and the window must be set to 13.
