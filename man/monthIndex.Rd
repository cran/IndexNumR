\title{Generate an index of months}
\usage{
monthIndex(x, overlapWeeks = "naive")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector or column of dates}

\item{overlapWeeks}{Tells monthIndex how to deal with weeks that
cross over two adjacent months. Options are "naive", "majority", "wholeOnly" or "fourWeek".
"naive" simply takes the month number of the observation, ignoring where
the week of that observation falls. "majority" will allocate the observation
to the month that owns the majority of days in that week, assuming
that Monday is day one of the week. "fourWeek" first calculates a week index,
then calculates the month index assuming that there are four weeks in each month.
"wholeOnly" will return NA for any dates falling inside a week that overlaps two
adjacent months; that is, only weeks that are wholly within a month
are given an index value. The default is "naive".}

A function to create a month index variable

\examples{
# given a vector of dates
df <- data.frame(date = as.Date(c("2017-01-01","2017-02-01","2017-03-01","2017-04-01"),
format = "\%Y-\%m-\%d"))
# calculate the time period variable
df$period <- monthIndex(df$date, overlapWeeks = "naive")
df
